# User Story 2, Remove a Plant from a Plot
# As a visitor
# When I visit a plot's index page
# Next to each plant's name
# I see a link to remove that plant from that plot
# When I click on that link
# I'm returned to the plots index page
# And I no longer see that plant listed under that plot
# (Note: you should not destroy the plant record entirely)
